# Robotic-Design-Final Notes
This is my first programming project that I found suitable to be posted to GitHub.
In the robotic design class, I wrote Iterative robot code for team 5122's aerial assist robot.
For my final, I chose (with help) to write command-based code for the same robot.
Because I am just getting familiar with Git and Github, I only learned how to push code after the final version was completed.
In this repository, you will see the final code. Every function works, including the two-ball autonomous command group and SmartDashboard buttons.
I apologize about the lack of comments. I left them out because I had a strict due-date to finish by. Perhaps soon I will make another commit with comments in the code. Stay tuned.
Code completion date: June 12, 2015.
